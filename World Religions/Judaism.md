#Judaism 

According to tradition, 4000 years ago God called Abram and made the following promise :

"Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of earth shall be blessed." Genesis 12:1-3

Descendants of Abraham's grandson Jacob, later renamed Israel, founded twelve tribes known as the "Children of Israel" or Israelites.

Later God spoke to Moses and revealed Himself:

"Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be treasured possession out of all peoples. Indeed, the whole earth is mine, but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation." Exodus 19: 5-6

God revealed Himself by saying - 

"I am Who am"

The people of Good learned to know and love their God, especially by his interaction with them. God spoke to their leaders and prophets and through these dialogues He built His community, based on a covenant.

<b>Covenant</b> - The agreement established between God and the ancient Israelites, first through Abraham and later through, oses, that designates the Jews as God's Chosen People, with special rights and responsibilities.

<b>Responsibility of Israelites</b> - TO have no God except for Him. To follow his commandments.
