#Judaism 

According to tradition, 4000 years ago God called Abram and made the following promise :

"Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of earth shall be blessed." Genesis 12:1-3

Descendants of Abraham's grandson Jacob, later renamed Israel, founded twelve tribes known as the "Children of Israel" or Israelites.

Later God spoke to Moses and revealed Himself:

"Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be treasured possession out of all peoples. Indeed, the whole earth is mine, but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation." Exodus 19: 5-6

God revealed Himself by saying - 

"I am Who am"
