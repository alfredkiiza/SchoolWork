The Genocide of Europe's Jews

## T-4

The Nazi's program of exterminating those who did not conform to their ideals of racial purity began several years before the outbreak of WWII, and initially had little to do with Jews. The Germans enacted the T-4 program to "mercifully" euthanize those who the state considered to be "living without life." Thousands of the mentally and physically disabled, as well as the psychologically troubled, were murdered upon doctors orders by the state. While Hitler and his minions rarely directly addressed the T-4 program, it was described as a painful but necessary step to ensure the perfection of the German race over the course of several generations. Ultimately, growing criticism of the program from the pulpits of the Protestant and Catholic Churches forced the government to suspend the program. 

## The First Concentration Camps

Concentration camps were one of the first new programs instituted by the Hitler government once it came to power in 1933. Modeled on Stalin's gulags, the concentration camps were originally meant to house political opponents of the Nazis, such as communists and anarchists. As time wore on, however, the concentration camps became home to political offenders of all strips and well as other religious dissidents and groups.

## "Salvation Through Work"

When the Germans invaded Eastern Europe in 1939 and 1940, they occupied cities that had had large Jewish communities dating back to the Middle Ages. Because concentration camps were largely improvised prison camps meant for dissidents, there was no large-scale plan for relocation and extermination. Jews were confined to the ghettos, in many cases hemmed in by barbed wire. Local community and religious leaders were tasked to keep order in the ghettos, in some cases given dictatorial powers by the Nazi occupying forces.
