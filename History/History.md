<b>The Nazi Quest for Empire</b>

## German Demographics

Although the modern nation of Germany has only existed since the 1870's, the German people have been a historical presence since the time 
of the Roman Empire. The collapse of Rome and the weakness of feudal governments allowed the German people to gradually spread throughout Western and Central Europe. 
By the 1930's there were substantial pockets of Germans living in France, Poland, and the Soviet Union. 

## "Living Space"

Nazi ideology played to this notion of the German "nation", that Germans living in other countries should rightfully be united with the <i>Grobdeutsches Reich</i>, or Greater German Empire. Drawing on the expansionist precedents set by Russian in the 17th century and the US in the 19th century, Hitler envisioned Central Europe as part of an expansive
German empire, with settlers living on conquered land. The Slavic peoples living in Central and Eastern Europe were subhuman squatters who were to be evicted or forced into slavery.

## Re-Armament

Germany's military had been hamstrung as a result of the Versailles treaty, and was forbidden under international law from developing an air force or large navy. 
Almost immediately after taking office in 1933, Hitler began secretly building an air force, although the signs of re-armament were clear: Germany significantly increased its imports of aluminum, copper, and Swiss machine tooling parts. 

## Public Declaration

Hitler publicly announced that he was no longer going to abide by the military restrictions imposed on Germany in late 1935.
While technically grounds for war with Britain and France, the war-weary and economically battered populace of Western Europe was largely indifferent towards Hitler's provocative act. There was actually considerable support for Hitler's actions int he British press. 

## The Rhine Crisis

Having succeeded in publicly rearming, Hitler decided to press his advantage with regard to Britain and France. The Rhine River valley, home to much of Germany's industry, was demilitarized after WWI. In March of 1936, Hitler announced his decision to re-militarize the region, and sent a division of German troops into the Rhineland. A tense, three day standoff ensued; and the German action was clear grounds for war, and this directly affected French security. Close consultations with its allies revealed that France would stand alone in the face of a war with Germany. France relented, and Hitler had driven the first wedge between the Western allies.


## Nazism in Austria

Like many Austrians, Hitler considered himself first and foremost a German, and resented what he considered the artificial division of Germany after the Frano-Prussian war. A native of Austria, Hitler's triumph in Germany served to rally the far right in Vienna and other major Austrian cities.
Although initially suppressed by the Austrian government, the Nazi party grew into a great force. The Austrian government's refusal to pursue such a policy led to considerable political violence. An assassination occurs.
