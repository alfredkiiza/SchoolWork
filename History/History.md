<b>The Nazi Quest for Empire</b>

## German Demographics

Although the modern nation of Germany has only existed since the 1870's, the German people have been a historical presence since the time 
of the Roman Empire. The collapse of Rome and the weakness of feudal governments allowed the German people to gradually spread throughout Western and Central Europe. 
By the 1930's there were substantial pockets of Germans living in France, Poland, and the Soviet Union. 

## "Living Space"

Nazi ideology played to this notion of the German "nation", that Germans living in other countries should rightfully be united with the <i>Grobdeutsches Reich</i>, or Greater German Empire. Drawing on the expansionist precedents set by Russian in the 17th century and the US in the 19th century, Hitler envisioned Central Europe as part of an expansive
German empire, with settlers living on conquered land. The Slavic peoples living in Central and Eastern Europe were subhuman squatters who were to be evicted or forced into slavery.

## Re-Armament

Germany's military had been hamstrung as a result of the Versailles treaty, and was forbidden under international law from developing an air force or large navy. 
Almost immediately after taking office in 1933, Hitler began secretly building an air force, although the signs of re-armament were clear: Germany significantly increased its imports of aluminum, copper, and Swiss machine tooling parts. 

## Public Declaration

Hitler publicly announced that he was no longer going to abide by the military restrictions imposed on Germany in late 1935.
While technically grounds for war with Britain and France, the war-weary and economically battered populace of Western Europe was largely indifferent towards Hitler's provocative act. There was actually considerable support for Hitler's actions int he British press. 

## The Rhine Crisis

Having succeeded in publicly rearming, Hitler decided to press his advantage with regard to Britain and France. The Rhine River valley, home to much of Germany's industry, was demilitarized after WWI. In March of 1936, Hitler announced his decision to re-militarize the region, and sent a division of German troops into the Rhineland. A tense, three day standoff ensued; and the German action was clear grounds for war, and this directly affected French security. Close consultations with its allies revealed that France would stand alone in the face of a war with Germany. France relented, and Hitler had driven the first wedge between the Western allies.


## Nazism in Austria

Like many Austrians, Hitler considered himself first and foremost a German, and resented what he considered the artificial division of Germany after the Frano-Prussian war. A native of Austria, Hitler's triumph in Germany served to rally the far right in Vienna and other major Austrian cities.
Although initially suppressed by the Austrian government, the Nazi party grew into a great force. The Austrian government's refusal to pursue such a policy led to considerable political violence. An assassination occurs.

# The Sino-Japanese War

## The Failure of Democracy

The Japanese political system favored strong emperor over a weakened Diet (parliament). During the 1910's and early 1920's 
the throne was held by Taisho, whose reclusive nature and ill-defined health problems make him problematic for historians to this day.
While this did allow for the development of political factions, it also greatly strengthened the military leadership who chafed at Japan's subordinate status in the internal balance of power. As exemplified by the Washington Naval Conference which limited the Japanese fleet to a fraction

# The Spanish Civil War

## An Empire in Decline

The Spanish Empire, one the world's wealthiest and most powerful nation, was in decline since the late 1700's.
It's colonies in Latin American had declared their independence, its efforts to industrialize were late and half hearted, and they were displaced in the world's shipping lanes by Britain, France, and the US. A final, humiliating blow was struck in 1898, when the US seized Spain's Caribbean colonies and the Philippines.

## Spain in World War I

When war broke out in 1914, the Spanish PM Eduardo Dato de Iradier took the divisive step of declaring neutrality. This produced short-term economic gain, as Spain was able to dominate markets abandoned by economies that had shifted to war production. As the war dragged on, however, Spain's economy was strangled by its inability to import needed materials. This downturn exacerbated the political divide over neutrality, with the more boisterous, pro-war faction increasingly pro-German. 

## The Rif War

Spain's sole remaining substantial colony in 1919 was Morocco, and even then lacked full control over the territory, vast areas of Morocco were still held by Berber chieftains, making transportation and communications difficult for Spain. The Spanish launched a long difficult war to subdue the Berber tribes, a conflict that would take seven years and French intervention to stave off a Spanish defeat. Although it was a victory, the Spanish government's conduct during the war led t a crisis of confidence in the regime. 

## The Turn Towards Authoritarianism

WIth the Madrid government seemingly unable to secure a final victory over the Moroccans, many members of the military grew disillusioned with civilian rule. A high-ranking Barcelona army officer, Miguel Primo de Rivera, asks King Alfonso to dissolve the government and appoint him prime minister. The king's acquiescence in this bloodless military coup would set the stage for years of conflict between the Spanish Left and Right.

## Franco

Rising officer in the Rif War, a prominent early support of Rivera, Franco was a career army man. The son of a naval postmaster, Franco was admitted to a military academy in Toledo, despite his relatively short stature. Franco would gain a reputation for unyielding conservatism; the first time he enters the historical records 1917, when he broke up a coal miners' strike. He became the youngest general in Europe at the age of 34. He was placed in the system of war colleges leading to contacts in France later on. 

## The Birth of the Spanish Republic

While Franco was a supporter of Rivera, he was intelligent enough to keep his distance; when it became clear that Rivera was unable to cope with Spain's deep economic problems, the pseudo-dictator lost popular support. King Alfonso called for a new election, which would be the first to be held freely and fairly in Spain for more than 60 years. The outcome was a resounding victory for left-wing republican parties. ALfonso XIII abdicated and Miguel Azana, a political opponent of Franco, became the prime minister after a brief provisional government.

## Summer of 1939

In the summer of 1939, the continent of Europe enjoyed an uneasy peace. Britain and France, the largest military powers in the world, appeared on paper to be the strongest they had ever been. While Adolf Hitler's Germany had expanded dramatically over the past two years, the German Chancellor apparently had been placated; his territorial ambitions sated, the indignities of Versailles a thing of the past. Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy appeared to have worked.
