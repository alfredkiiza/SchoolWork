"From Moscow to Berlin"

## The Battle of Karkov

With the German advance stalled outside of Moscow, fresh reserves of Soviet troops fro the interior of the country arrived to help push the Wehrmacht back, ultimately driving them 200 miles back away from the Soviet capital. Seeking to drive a wedge between German army groups North and Centre, the Red Army advanced towards Smolensk, intending to liberate the besieged city. A spectacularly failed paratrooper insertion enabled the Germans to recover and regroup their forces, putting an end to the Soviet counteroffensive. 

## Stalingrad

Despite its relative lack of strategic value, Hitler insisted that the city of Stalingrad be reduced to rubble. To this end, Hitler committed unlimited resources to the army groups tasked with conquering the city, and Stalingrad became a black hole for the German army. The battle of Stalingrad raged from July of 1942, until Feb of 1943. The battle is the bloodiest in human history, which each side numbering about 750,000 killed in action and the Soviet Union taking more than 40,000 civilian casualties as well.

## Kursk

Bolstered by the victory at Stalingrad, the Red Army had punched a hole in the German lines at Kursk, where they set about turning the area into an elaborate maze of minefields, tank traps, pillboxes, and trenches. Despite the enormous casualties the Soviets endured at Stalingrad, they were able to regroup by drafting men and such. 

## Smolensk

With 500,000 troops lost at Kursk, the Germans were reeling, and the Red Army continued to grow in strength as it regained territory. The Soviet leadership saw the Smolensk region, occupied by Germany since the summer of 1941, as a key to preventing a future attempt by the Germans to attack Moscow. in August and September of 1943, The soviets launched waves of attacks on Smolensk, and made very modest territorial gains due to stiff German resistance. 

## Crimea and Romania

With the Germans now in full retreat, the Russians pushed forward into the Crimea, once the site of Russia's humiliation a century before. Germany, joined by its Romanian allies, were pinned against the Black Sea, much as the British had been at Dunkrik four years previously. A botched evacuation attempt led to the loss of 65,000.

## The Warsaw Uprising

As the Soviet forces lumbered towards Poland in late 1944, the Polish Home Army launched a rebellion across the country. One of the major centers of this uprising was in the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw. Despite the fact that Soviet agents had promised assistance to the local insurgents, Stalin deliberately refused to provide aid, wishing to sweep the field clear of any resistance to the incoming Soviet occupation. As a result, the Gestapo was able to seal off the ghetto and wait the rebellion out When theGermans finally moved in, the massacred th remaining Jews of Warsaw.
