# History Notes

## America Enters the War

The United States felt cheated by its participation in World War I, the ideals it felt it represented were not victorious in the war, thousands of Americans had died in a Euro war, and in many cases, the US had not been repaid its war loans.

US participation in the outside world reached its nadir under Franklin Roosevelt, whose "Good Neighbor Policy" limited our involvement in Latin America.

## Isolationism, or pro-Nazism? 

By the mid 1930's, the sizable German-American population had developed a small but vocal pro-Nazi movement, the German-American Bund, who advocated a neutral US foreign policy to give Hitler a free hand in Europe. Many anti-war advocates, including famed aviator Charles Lindbergh, were warmly embraced by the Bund and even by the Nazi leadership. 

Comparatively few Americans ideologically supported fascism, but many remained skeptical.

## Lend-Lease

While Franklin Roosevelt despised the regimes of Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo, he felt that there was little he could constitutionally d without a declaration of war from Congress that would not likely be forthcoming He could, however, use his constitutional powers to impose trade sanctions on the Axis powers while issuing government loans and war material to the embattled Allies. From early 1940 on, the British war effort was heavily supplemented with American Lend-Lease aid, agreed to after the clandestine meeting between FDR and Churchill at sea.

## Tensions with Japan

While the United States in many ways forced the modernization of Japan, as the 20th century progressed the two nations served as economic competitors. While Japan was reliant on the US for the raw resources it needed to power its industries, cheap Japanese products sered as competitors in many Asian-Pacific markets. These economic tensions were exacerbated by Japan's brutal war against China.

## Embargo

Ultimately, FDR's outrage with Japanese atrocities in the pacific led to sweeping sanctions in the summer of 1941, meant o cripple Japan's ability to make war. FDR imposed sanctions on exports of rubber, iron, aluminum, and oil. A classified report on Japanese military resources (later recovered by the US), dated July 1941 estimated that the Japanese military would run out of fuel by the end of the year.

## Yamamoto

In the summer of 1941, the Japanese naval commander Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto, was called upon to draft a daring strategy to cripple the American Pacific fleet, which FDR had provocatively moved to Hawaii from San Fran. Yamoto had attended various exchange programs in the United States even attending seminars at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. He had a deep understanding of the US.

## A Day Which Will Live in Infamy

The US had cracked Japan's diplomatic code months in advance of Pearl Harbor, and mistakenly believed that an attack was coming in the Philippines, far from America's ability to project power. Consequently, American aircraft carriers were absent in the first weeks of December, 1941, delivering planes to US Navy and Marine bases across the Pacific. The strongest weapons in the American arsenal managed to escape the Japanese sneak attack that disabled Pearl Harbor well into 1942 and killed many US servicemen.
