#Post-WWII

## Failure of the League

The League of Nations (LoN) had begun with lofty promises to end war amongst developed nation.s Less than two decades after its founding, it had been embarrassed and discredited by Axis adventurism in north Africa, Europe and east Asia. Less than three decades after its founding, the most costly war in human history had been fought. Over 70 million had died, entire nations were ruined, and the principal perpetrators were punished by no more than League censure, a written letter of displeasure. Its goal of preventing a new world war evidently failed, the League of Nations voluntarily dissolved in April of 1946, long after the League had outlived its usefulness, and after it had decided on a successor organization with a better chance of ensuring global peace: the United Nations.

# The UN

A new framework for multilateral diplomacy was obviously needed; the League had failed to prevent the Second World War and the Allies were a makeshift military alliance. Nevertheless, the unique scale of the Allies had something to recommend it, the sort of legitimacy that only participation by the overwhelming majority of the world's nations could procure. Allied propaganda increasingly referred to the United Nations and at the Tehran conference, the leaders of the three great Allied Nations agreed to a new inter-nations framework to protect the new, potentially fragile new world order. 

## Ratification

The treaty ratifying the new international organization was signed in San Francisco on April 25, 1956, before either Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan had surrendered. Six official languages were declared: English, French, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic. The first meetings of the new organization, dedicated to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" were held in London in Jan of 1946, until a new, permanent headquarters could be established in the city with the greatest claim to the leadership of the international community: New York
