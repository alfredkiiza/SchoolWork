<center>Rommel and the Battle for North Africa</center>

## Egypt Imperiled

By the summer of 1940, the Axis controlled the majority of the North African coastline. Spanish Morocco, the possession of a neutral power, provided a comfortable buffer in the rear, while Vichy French Algeria and Italian Libya provided ample staging area for the invasion of British Egypt. The target- the Suez canal, the vital artery connecting Britain to its Asian empire. 

## Rommel

The overall German commander in North Africa was one of, if not the, most talented tank commanders in the world. General Erwin Rommell had achieved prominence in the battle for France. Never an ardent Nazi, Rommel was nevertheless a smooth political operator who won Hitler's trust and admiration. His disdain for the Italian general staff endeared him to the German High Command, who were increasingly frustrated with their ally. 

## Sidi Barrani

The first major Axis offensive of the North Africa campaign proved to be a disaster. The Italian army sent a 200,000 man force against the British fortifications at Sidi Barrani on the Libyan/Egyptian border. Despite the fact that the British were outnumbered nearly 10 to 1, the entrenched British artillery and machine guns, combined with the near-total lack of cover for the Italian forces, led to an embarrassing rout for the Italians in the closing months of 1940. It was one of the first major British victories. 

## Tobruk

Although the Italians had stalled, Rommel disobeyed orders and pushed forward, exposing his newly formed Afrika Korps to danger in an effort to take Tobruk.

## El-Alamein

Ultimately, the Axis advance was pushed back at El-Alamein in late October of 1942, when the British received re-enforcements. Due to the unexpected death of overall British commander William Gott, command was given to the man who would prove to be Rommel's match. <b>Bernard Montgomery.</b> 

## Torch

By the autumn of 1942, American forces were beginning to arrive in large numbers in North Africa. Operation Torch saw the arrival of nearly 200,000 soldiers as well as heavy armor. In the first battle of the war, Kasserine pass, the Americans suffered their only defeat against Germany. German possession of the high ground over the pass rendered the Americans vulnerable and unable to strike back. The Americans learned that the best way to defeat the German effort in North Africa was not through tactical movement but through outnumbering and overpowering. 

## Tunisia and Defeat

Despite Axis advances in 1943, the Allies were beginning to develop strats and they introduce new weapon to overwhelm the Germans during the Tunisian campaign of 1943. The supply situation essentially undid German superiority in engineering.
