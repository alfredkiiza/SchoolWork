<center>Rommel and the Battle for North Africa</center>

## Egypt Imperiled

By the summer of 1940, the Axis controlled the majority of the North African coastline. Spanish Morocco, the possession of a neutral power, provided a comfortable buffer in the rear, while Vichy French Algeria and Italian Libya provided ample staging area for the invasion of British Egypt. The target- the Suez canal, the vital artery connecting Britain to its Asian empire. 

## Rommel

The overall German commander in North Africa was one of, if not the, most talented tank commanders in the world. General Erwin Rommell had achieved prominence in the battle for France. Never an ardent Nazi, Rommel was nevertheless a smooth political operator who won Hitler's trust and admiration. His disdain for the Italian general staff endeared him to the German High Command, who were increasingly frustrated with their ally. 

## Sidi Barrani

The first major Axis offensive of the North Africa campaign proved to be a disaster. The Italian army sent a 200,000 man force against the British fortifications at Sidi Barrani on the Libyan/Egyptian border. Despite the fact that the British were outnumbered nearly 10 to 1, the entrenched British artillery and machine guns, combined with the near-total lack of cover for the Italian forces, led to an embarrassing rout for the Italians in the closing months of 1940. It was one of the first major British victories. 

## Tobruk

Although the Italians had stalled, Rommel disobeyed orders and pushed forward, exposing his newly formed Afrika Korps to danger in an effort to take Tobruk.

## El-Alamein

Ultimately, the Axis advance was pushed back at El-Alamein in late October of 1942, when the British received re-enforcements. Due to the unexpected death of overall British commander William Gott, command was given to the man who would prove to be Rommel's match. <b>Bernard Montgomery.</b> 

## Torch

By the autumn of 1942, American forces were beginning to arrive in large numbers in North Africa. Operation Torch saw the arrival of nearly 200,000 soldiers as well as heavy armor. In the first battle of the war, Kasserine pass, the Americans suffered their only defeat against Germany. German possession of the high ground over the pass rendered the Americans vulnerable and unable to strike back. The Americans learned that the best way to defeat the German effort in North Africa was not through tactical movement but through outnumbering and overpowering. 

## Tunisia and Defeat

Despite Axis advances in 1943, the Allies were beginning to develop strats and they introduce new weapon to overwhelm the Germans during the Tunisian campaign of 1943. The supply situation essentially undid German superiority in engineering.

## "Strength Through Joy"

Hitler was keenly aware of the fact that the last world war nearly ended in German revolution primarily due to the shortages imposed by wartime necessity. No dictatorship is completely immune from public opinion, and Hitler was reluctant to put the German economy fully on a war footing. Nazi Germany therefore did not impose rationing until 1943, well after the US and Britain did. Hitler also encouraged popular entertainment like theater and sports to keep morale high.

## Life in the Occupied West

Throughout most of the earlier half of the war, before Allied bombing began in earnest, life continued reasonably normally for people in occupied France, Denmark, and the Low Countries. While their puppet rulers held power at Hitler's pleasure, and communist and dissident movements were crushed, a high standard of living did continue. As Germany's war situation eroded, particularly as the Eastern Front grew more desperate, more resources were devoted to the Wehrmacht's material requirements, and food and fuel shortages became increasingly common. Black markets emerged in many major cities in occupied Western Europe. 

## Resistance

Although guerilla fighting did not reach the intensity it did in the East, there were resistance movements in most of the occupied countries of Western Europe, most notably in France. Members of the French resistance, dubbed the Maquis, maintained radio contact with Charles de Gaulle's Free French in Britain and carried out espionage and minor acts of warfare.

## Collaboration

Despite the hostile nature of German occupation, there were many who willingly collaborated with the Germans. As the war dragged on and Russia became a black hole for the German army, manpower shortages forced the Germans to increasingly rely on volunteers from the occupied territories. One of the principal tasks of the collaborators came later in the war, when Hitler decided on the Final Solution. Members of indigenous SS and Gestapo units often assisted their German counterparts in identifying Jews.

## Collaborations Punished

Collaborators were often identified and punished by local resistance; they were frequent targets for assassination. Over the course of the war, many German soldiers married or had love affairs with local women; after the war, many of them were paraded through the streets and publicly humiliated. 

## Occupation in the East

Due to German racial and anti-communist theory, the occupation of Eastern Europe was considerably less benign than in the West. Slavic states in some instances were allies of Germany, such as Bulgaria and Romania; the German presence was mutually  consensual. Occupied countries with large Jewish populations contributed the bulk of the victims of the Holocaust, again with the cooperation of local collaborators. 

## Slave Labor

As the war expanded in scope and began to impose greater hardships on Germany armaments minister Albert Speer increasingly began relying on Soviet POWs and civilians from the occupied east to free up German men of fighting age for frontline duty. Workers toiled in slave-like conditions and often died due to malnutrition and exhaustion. They were also the unintentional victims of Allied strategic bombing.
