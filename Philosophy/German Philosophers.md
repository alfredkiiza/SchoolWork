## Immanuel Kant

1. Kant believed that everything is apprehended through our bodily apparitions. (5 senses, brain, nervous system)

2. For Kant, there are two realms of existence :
	
	the Phenomenal World - is the world as it appears to us.
	the Noumenal World - is the world that exists independently.

3. Kant distinguished between what the world actually is, and the way it appears to us.
