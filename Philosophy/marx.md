# Marx

Karl Marx's ideas had a greater influence in a shorter time than those of any other thinker
in history. During his lifetime he was a little-known, impoverished intellectual, living on the charity
of friends and spending his days reading and writing, often in the British Museum. within 70 years of his death in 1883, a third of the entire human race was living under governments that called themselves by his name : "Marxist".

All of Eastern Europe, the whole of Russia, and the former Tsarist land empire, and all of China. Nothing like this had ever occurred before, nor is likely to happen again. Even the spread of early Christianity or Islam could not match it.
