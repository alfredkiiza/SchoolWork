	Simon Clode altered his will and left his property to Mrs. Eurydice Spragg rather than to his family.

	When the will was opened it was found to contain a sheet of blank paper.

	Mr. and Mrs. Spragg had the opportunity but not the motive while the family had the motive but not the opportunity.

	Miss Marple realized the pen had been in the wrong drawer.

	The will had been written with disappearing ink. 

	<b>Red flag</b> : Meeting with spragg, he dropped the document on the floor

	He asks for the pen, and she goes over to get a pen, but she went into the wrong draw for the pen.
