# Notes for Monday

Sir Henry had arrived in London, he gets a note crafted from newspaper article notes that threaten him to not go to the moor.

Holmes decided to search the wastebaskets for the hotels...

He also noticed that the man had a beer; they sent a telegram to the morgue immediately to be delivered to Barrymore.

The identification of the carriage it had a number on it : 

"Barrymore is at the hall" - couldn't be him

as it turns out, this isn't true. When Watson gets out to the moor, it was disproved.

They find the carriage driver 

He mentioned his name : Mr. Sherlock Holmes ! // We know this isn't true. What we thought was a lead wasn't.. <b>"reversal"</b>

## Mystery of the Boot

The brown boots were brand new. Why would he put it out to be polished if it was brand new? 

The second boot is missing. It is an older boot. 

Before he leaves for the marshes, he finds the "new" brown boot, where he knew he looked before.

Why would someone steal a new boot? 

Answer : Because it's new... doesn't smell like the "old" boot would.
